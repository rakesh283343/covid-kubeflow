Now we need to add metrics like:
 1. Active Cases
 2. Recoveries Total and New
 3. New Cases (confirmed today - confirmed yesterday
 4. New Deaths

Plan
----
First we need to assign new cases every day (all new on first day of reporting)

Then get "New Confirmed" and "New Deaths"

Then Check if "recovered" is > 0- assuming its not- infer recoveries.
- Look at new cases N_1 days ago (where N is average time to recovery or death)
- Now look at deaths on N_2 days ago (I know, this is kind of sloppy, but we can make it better later, cant take sum or you'll double count).
- New cases from step 1 - deaths over last N days = recoveries.
- Issue: Have to calculate deaths since that is a longer. E.g. We can only "call" recoveries for N_2 days ago. Also, 
  must do deaths first. Recovered today = People infect N_1 days ago minus people who die (N_2-N_1) days in the future. 
   

Once we have New Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries- Active cases is trvial.

> The likelihood of recovering replication-competent virus also declines after onset of symptoms. For patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, replication-competent virus has not been recovered after 10 days following symptom onset (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; WÃ¶lfel et al., 2020; Arons et al., 2020; Bullard et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; personal communication with Young et al., 2020; Korea CDC, 2020). Recovery of replication-competent virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19 that, in some cases, was complicated by immunocompromised state (van Kampen et al., 2020). However, in this series of patients, it was estimated that 88% and 95% of their specimens no longer yielded replication-competent virus after 10 and 15 days, respectively, following symptom onset.
